## Project Category

### Productivity & Workflow Tool

**GenericSuite CodeGen** is an AI-Powered Development Tool / Code Generation System that boosts the SDLC flow, save time and simplify everyday tasks for developers.

## The Kiro-Driven Development Approach

### 1. Strategic Conversation Structure

The development process was methodically structured around Kiro's capabilities:

**Foundation Phase**: The development cycle began with the comprehensive [BuildPrompt.md](./BuildPrompt.md) initial prompt file - a 1,981-line specification that served as the project's north star.

This document contained:
- Complete architecture specifications
- Technology stack requirements
- Database schemas and API endpoints
- Code generation rules and patterns
- Environment configuration templates

The template to generate the [prompt](./BuildPrompt.md) can be found [here](https://github.com/coleam00/ottomator-agents/blob/main/foundational-rag-agent/PLANNING.md). It was adapted to the project requirements: use MongoDB Vector Search, monorepo project structure using npm workspaces, deployment scripts and configuration files, use of ReactJS, etc.

Once the first version of the [prompt](./BuildPrompt.md) was ready, the SLDC process was started with the following prompt:

```prompt
Start planning using the context on the #BuildPrompt.md file
```

Kiro started generating the [requirements.md](./.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen/requirements.md) file. It was reviewed and I noticed some missing elements, so the initial prompt was modified 4+ times to fix it. Each time the prompt was modified, the `requirements.md` file was regenerated using the "Refine" button.

Once ready, the `Move to the design phase` button was clicked. Kiro started generating the [design.md](./.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen/design.md) file. Once reviewed, click on the `Move to the tasks phase` button. Then Kiro generated the [tasks.md](./.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen/tasks.md) file.

Then the first [specs](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/) files were generated:

* [requirements.md](./.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen/requirements.md)
* [design.md](./.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen/design.md)
* [tasks.md](./.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen/tasks.md)

They can be checked in the "[.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen](./.kiro/specs/genericsuite-codegen/)" directory.

**Feature-Driven Development**: Each new feature (not contained in the initial prompt) was developed in dedicated chat sessions, allowing for:
- Focused context without overwhelming Kiro with unrelated code
- Clean conversation history for each component
- Easier debugging and iteration on specific features
- Maintained context relevance throughout development

The additional `specs` created were:
* [deploy-dependency-sync](./.kiro/specs/deploy-dependency-sync/)

**Task-Specific Problem Solving**: When implementation issues arose, dedicated chats were opened for specific task steps, enabling:
- Targeted troubleshooting without context pollution
- Detailed error analysis and resolution
- Iterative refinement of complex components

As an example, `specs` created for problems found in the development process were:
* [chat-conversation-fixes](./.kiro/specs/chat-conversation-fixes/)

### 2. Spec-to-Code Excellence

The project leveraged Kiro's spec-driven development capabilities extensively:

**Clear Requirements Translation**: The approach was elegantly simple yet powerful:
- Open new chat session
- Describe desired functionality with precision and clarity
- Let Kiro handle the complete implementation planning and execution

**Structured Implementation Process**: Kiro's spec system provided:
- **Requirements Phase**: Comprehensive user stories with EARS format acceptance criteria
- **Design Phase**: Detailed architecture with component interfaces and data models
- **Tasks Phase**: Granular, executable implementation steps with clear dependencies

## Things I like and dislike about Kiro

Pros:
* Kiro Chat is awesome. It generates these three files, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`, in an efficient and clear manner.
* The ability to execute tasks interactively using the `task.md` file allows you to track the entire creative and development process like no other IDE offers.

Cons:
* It doesn't have the commit description generator that Cursor and Windsurf offer.
* When opening folders, it doesn't have the `View Other` option, only the 5 recent projects.
* The `Tab Completion` code generation is very lazy.
* I suddenly lost the ability to `Cmd-click` to navigate to Python definitions.
* Extensions like `Autopep8` is incredibly slow and sometimes doesn't remove the red dots (those that indicate errors).
* The toll tip `Chat Cmd-L / Edit Cmd-I` that appears on the top line when searching is super annoying.
