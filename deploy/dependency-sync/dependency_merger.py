Dependency Merger Module

Combines and deduplicates dependencies from multiple sources with conflict resolution.

This module provides functionality to merge dependency dictionaries from multiple
pyproject.toml files and resolve version constraint conflicts. It implements a
conflict resolution strategy that chooses the most restrictive constraint when
conflicts are detected.

The merger handles various conflict scenarios:
- Exact vs range constraints (exact wins)
- Different minimum versions (higher wins)
- Constraints with vs without upper bounds (bounded wins)

Example:
    Basic merging:
    
    >>> merger = DependencyMerger()
    >>> deps1 = {'fastapi': '^0.100.0', 'uvicorn': '^0.24.0'}
    >>> deps2 = {'fastapi': '^0.95.0', 'pydantic': '^2.0.0'}
    >>> merged = merger.merge_dependencies(deps1, deps2)
    >>> print(merged)
    {'fastapi': '^0.100.0', 'uvicorn': '^0.24.0', 'pydantic': '^2.0.0'}
    
    Conflict resolution:
    
    >>> deps1 = {'package': '>=1.0.0'}
    >>> deps2 = {'package': '>=1.5.0'}
    >>> merged = merger.merge_dependencies(deps1, deps2)
    >>> print(merged['package'])  # '>=1.5.0' (more restrictive)
