# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the GenericSuite CodeGen system's vector search capabilities to ensure generated code consistently follows GenericSuite patterns and rules. The enhancement involves performing contextual searches based on the type of code being generated and utilizing local document storage for comprehensive rule retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using GenericSuite CodeGen, I want the system to automatically search for relevant GenericSuite rules and examples based on the type of code being generated, so that the generated code follows established patterns and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating JSON table configuration THEN the system SHALL perform a vector search for "give me the rules and examples of how to create a JSON table configuration in Genericsuite"
2. WHEN generating LangChain tools THEN the system SHALL perform a vector search for "give me the rules and examples of how to create a langchain tool in Genericsuite"
3. WHEN generating MCP server tools THEN the system SHALL perform a vector search for "give me the rules and examples of how to create a mcp server tool in Genericsuite"
4. WHEN generating frontend code THEN the system SHALL perform a vector search for "give me the rules and examples of how to create frontend code in Genericsuite"
5. WHEN generating backend code THEN the system SHALL perform a vector search for "give me the rules and examples of how to create backend code in Genericsuite"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to perform dual vector searches (user query + contextual rules), so that both my specific requirements and GenericSuite conventions are considered during code generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code generation request is made THEN the system SHALL perform two separate vector searches
2. WHEN performing dual searches THEN the system SHALL search for user requirements AND contextual GenericSuite rules
3. WHEN combining search results THEN the system SHALL merge and prioritize results from both searches
4. WHEN no contextual rules are found THEN the system SHALL proceed with user query results only
5. IF contextual rules conflict with user requirements THEN the system SHALL prioritize GenericSuite conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the vector search results to be retrieved from local document storage, so that the system has access to the complete GenericSuite knowledge base for accurate code generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector search returns document references THEN the system SHALL retrieve full document content from local storage
2. WHEN documents are not found locally THEN the system SHALL log the missing documents and continue with available content
3. WHEN reading local documents THEN the system SHALL handle file access errors gracefully
4. WHEN multiple documents are retrieved THEN the system SHALL combine their content for comprehensive context
5. IF local storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to vector search snippets only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced search to work seamlessly with existing code generation workflows, so that I don't need to change how I interact with the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing API endpoints THEN the enhanced search SHALL be automatically applied
2. WHEN generating code through the web interface THEN the dual search SHALL be transparent to the user
3. WHEN using MCP server integration THEN the enhanced search SHALL work without configuration changes
4. WHEN streaming responses THEN the enhanced search SHALL not significantly impact response time
5. IF enhanced search fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to original search behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want configurable search templates for different code types, so that I can easily update or add new contextual search patterns without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new code generation types THEN the system SHALL support configurable search templates
2. WHEN updating search patterns THEN the system SHALL reload templates without restart
3. WHEN templates are malformed THEN the system SHALL log errors and use default patterns
4. WHEN no template exists for a code type THEN the system SHALL use a generic GenericSuite rules search
5. IF template configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use hardcoded fallback templates
