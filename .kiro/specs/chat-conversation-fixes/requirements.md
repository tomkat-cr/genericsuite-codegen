# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the chat conversation management system in the GenericSuite CodeGen application. The current implementation has problems with message storage, conversation title management, and lacks essential user functionality for managing conversations. This spec will fix these issues and enhance the user experience with proper conversation management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat messages to be properly stored in the correct conversation so that I can maintain conversation history and context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message in an existing conversation THEN the message SHALL be stored in that specific conversation's message array
2. WHEN an assistant responds to a user message THEN the assistant's response SHALL be stored in the same conversation as the user's message
3. WHEN a user switches between conversations THEN each conversation SHALL display only its own messages
4. WHEN a conversation is saved THEN all messages in that conversation SHALL persist in the database
5. WHEN the application is reloaded THEN all previously saved messages SHALL be displayed in their correct conversations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want each conversation to have a unique and meaningful title so that I can easily identify and distinguish between different conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new conversation is created THEN it SHALL have a unique title based on the first user message
2. WHEN multiple conversations are created THEN each conversation SHALL maintain its own distinct title
3. WHEN a conversation title is generated THEN it SHALL be derived from the first 50 characters of the initial user message
4. WHEN a conversation is saved THEN its title SHALL remain consistent and not be overwritten by other conversations
5. WHEN conversations are displayed in the sidebar THEN each SHALL show its correct, unique title

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete conversations I no longer need so that I can keep my conversation list organized and remove unwanted chat history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the delete button on a conversation THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
2. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the conversation SHALL be permanently removed from the database
3. WHEN a conversation is deleted THEN it SHALL be removed from the conversations list in the UI
4. WHEN the currently active conversation is deleted THEN the UI SHALL clear the chat area and show no active conversation
5. WHEN a conversation is deleted THEN the operation SHALL complete without affecting other conversations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to rename conversation titles so that I can organize my conversations with meaningful names that help me remember their content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a conversation title THEN it SHALL become editable
2. WHEN a user edits a conversation title THEN they SHALL be able to type a new title
3. WHEN a user presses Enter or clicks outside the title field THEN the new title SHALL be saved
4. WHEN a user presses Escape while editing THEN the title edit SHALL be cancelled and revert to the original
5. WHEN a title is successfully updated THEN it SHALL be saved to the database and reflected in the UI immediately
6. WHEN a title is empty or only whitespace THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the conversation management to work reliably so that I can trust the system to maintain my chat history accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a query request with a conversation ID THEN it SHALL correctly associate the messages with that conversation
2. WHEN a conversation is created on the frontend THEN it SHALL be properly synchronized with the backend
3. WHEN conversation data is retrieved from the database THEN it SHALL be correctly formatted and returned to the frontend
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each user SHALL only see and manage their own conversations
5. WHEN API errors occur during conversation operations THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
