# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dependency Sync feature provides automated synchronization of Python dependencies from Poetry pyproject.toml files to Docker pip installation commands. This ensures that Docker builds stay in sync with Poetry dependency specifications without manual maintenance, reducing deployment inconsistencies and build failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Poetry Dependency Parsing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically read and parse Poetry dependencies from multiple pyproject.toml files so that I don't have to manually track dependency changes across files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing pyproject.toml files THEN the system SHALL read the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section from each specified file
2. WHEN encountering multiple pyproject.toml files THEN the system SHALL merge all dependencies into a unified list
3. WHEN finding duplicate dependencies THEN the system SHALL use the highest version constraint or most restrictive constraint
4. WHEN parsing version constraints THEN the system SHALL handle Poetry version syntax including `^`, `~`, `>=`, `==`, and version ranges
5. WHEN encountering extras syntax THEN the system SHALL properly handle dependencies with extras like `uvicorn[standard]`

### Requirement 2: Poetry to Pip Translation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Poetry version constraints automatically translated to pip-compatible format so that Docker builds use equivalent dependency versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translating caret constraints THEN the system SHALL convert `^1.2.3` to `>=1.2.3,<2.0.0`
2. WHEN translating tilde constraints THEN the system SHALL convert `~1.2.3` to `>=1.2.3,<1.3.0`
3. WHEN translating exact versions THEN the system SHALL convert `==1.2.3` to `==1.2.3`
4. WHEN translating minimum versions THEN the system SHALL convert `>=1.2.3` to `>=1.2.3`
5. WHEN handling extras THEN the system SHALL preserve extras syntax like `uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0`

### Requirement 3: Dockerfile Update Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically update the pip install command in my Dockerfile so that Docker builds always use the correct dependencies without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating Dockerfile THEN the system SHALL locate the existing `RUN pip install` command block
2. WHEN replacing dependencies THEN the system SHALL preserve the pip install command structure and formatting
3. WHEN writing new dependencies THEN the system SHALL maintain readable multi-line format with backslashes
4. WHEN updating the file THEN the system SHALL preserve all other Dockerfile content unchanged
5. WHEN encountering formatting issues THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent indentation and line breaks

### Requirement 4: Configuration and Flexibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable source files and target Dockerfile paths so that the tool works with different project structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying source files THEN the system SHALL accept multiple pyproject.toml file paths as input
2. WHEN specifying target file THEN the system SHALL accept the Dockerfile path as a parameter
3. WHEN running the tool THEN the system SHALL validate that all specified files exist before processing
4. WHEN encountering missing files THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with file paths
5. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL handle relative and absolute paths correctly

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and validation so that I can quickly identify and fix issues with dependency synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating which file and line caused the issue
2. WHEN version constraints are invalid THEN the system SHALL report the problematic dependency and constraint
3. WHEN Dockerfile update fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the original file and report the error
4. WHEN dependencies conflict THEN the system SHALL warn about version constraint conflicts and show resolution
5. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of changes made

### Requirement 6: Command Line and Script Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both standalone script execution and integration capabilities so that I can use the tool manually or as part of automated build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running as a script THEN the system SHALL accept command line arguments for source and target files
2. WHEN integrating with build systems THEN the system SHALL provide importable functions for programmatic use
3. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes for success and failure
4. WHEN used in automation THEN the system SHALL support quiet mode with minimal output
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide verbose mode with detailed processing information

### Requirement 7: File Organization and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dependency sync tools organized in the deploy directory so that they are logically grouped with other deployment-related scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the solution THEN the Python script SHALL be located at `deploy/dependency-sync/sync_dependencies.py`
2. WHEN providing shell integration THEN the bash wrapper script SHALL be located at `deploy/dependency-sync/sync_dependencies.sh`
3. WHEN organizing files THEN the dependency-sync directory SHALL contain all related scripts and utilities
4. WHEN running from project root THEN the scripts SHALL work correctly with relative paths to pyproject.toml files
5. WHEN integrating with existing deploy scripts THEN the tool SHALL be easily callable from other deployment automation
